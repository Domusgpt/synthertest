# Android Testing Guide for Synther

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Flutter on Your Development Machine
```bash
# Download Flutter SDK from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
# Extract and add to PATH

# Verify installation
flutter doctor
```

### 2. Enable Developer Mode on Your Android Phone
1. Go to Settings â†’ About Phone
2. Tap "Build Number" 7 times
3. Go back to Settings â†’ Developer Options
4. Enable:
   - Developer options
   - USB debugging
   - Install via USB (if present)

### 3. Connect Your Phone
1. Connect phone via USB cable
2. Accept "Allow USB debugging" prompt on phone
3. Verify connection:
```bash
flutter devices
# Should show your device
```

## Quick Test Build

### Option 1: Debug Build (Fastest)
```bash
cd /path/to/Synther

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on connected device
flutter run

# This will:
# - Build debug APK
# - Install on your phone
# - Launch with hot reload enabled
# - Show console logs
```

### Option 2: Release APK Build
```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# The APK will be at:
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Install manually:
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Option 3: Split APKs (Smaller Size)
```bash
# Build split APKs by architecture
flutter build apk --split-per-abi

# This creates smaller APKs:
# - app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk (32-bit)
# - app-arm64-v8a-release.apk (64-bit)
# - app-x86_64-release.apk (Intel)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors

1. **"SDK not found"**
```bash
# Set up Android SDK
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

2. **"Gradle build failed"**
```bash
# Update Gradle
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

3. **"Package name conflict"**
```bash
# Uninstall existing app first
adb uninstall com.domusgpt.sound_synthesizer
```

### Runtime Issues

1. **No sound**
- Check phone volume
- Grant microphone permission
- Restart the app

2. **Ads not showing**
- Normal in debug mode
- Test ads should appear
- Check internet connection

3. **Crashes on launch**
```bash
# View crash logs
adb logcat | grep -E "flutter|synther"
```

## Quick Development Setup

### 1. Create Test Script
Create `test_on_phone.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "ðŸš€ Building Synther for Android..."

# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build and run
flutter run --release

echo "âœ… App should be running on your phone!"
```

### 2. Make it executable
```bash
chmod +x test_on_phone.sh
```

### 3. Run anytime
```bash
./test_on_phone.sh
```

## Firebase Test Setup (Optional)

### Quick Firebase Setup for Testing
1. Create a test Firebase project
2. Download `google-services.json`
3. Place in `android/app/`
4. The app will work without this, but with limited features

### Test User Flow
1. Launch app â†’ Works without login
2. Try saving preset â†’ Prompts for account
3. Create test account â†’ Free tier active
4. Test upgrade flow â†’ Shows subscriptions

## Wireless Debugging (Advanced)

### Setup Wireless ADB
```bash
# Connect phone via USB first
adb tcpip 5555

# Find phone's IP (Settings â†’ About â†’ IP address)
adb connect 192.168.1.XXX:5555

# Disconnect USB cable
# Now you can run Flutter wirelessly!
flutter run
```

## Performance Profiling

### Check Performance
```bash
# Run in profile mode
flutter run --profile

# Opens DevTools for:
# - CPU profiling
# - Memory usage
# - Network requests
# - Widget inspector
```

## Sharing APK with Others

### Create Shareable APK
```bash
# Build universal APK
flutter build apk --release

# Upload to Google Drive or send via:
# - Email (if <25MB)
# - Google Drive
# - WeTransfer
# - USB transfer
```

### Installation Instructions for Testers
1. Enable "Unknown sources" in Settings
2. Download APK
3. Tap to install
4. Grant requested permissions

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Note any issues** - Keep a list of bugs/improvements
2. **Check performance** - Note FPS, audio latency
3. **Test monetization** - Ensure ads and IAP work
4. **Get feedback** - Share with friends/musicians
5. **Iterate** - Fix issues before store release

## Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# Most common commands you'll use:
flutter run                      # Run debug build
flutter run --release           # Run release build
flutter build apk               # Build APK
