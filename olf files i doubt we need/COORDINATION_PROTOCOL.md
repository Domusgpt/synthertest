# ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS SYNTHER DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL

**System Status:** ACTIVE - Autonomous Claude Coordination Online  
**Lead Developer:** Coordinator Claude (This instance)  
**Mission:** Deliver working cross-platform audio-visual synthesizer

## üîÑ AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW SYSTEM

### SPECIALIST ACTIVATION SEQUENCE:
```
1. CLAUDE_NATIVE  ‚Üí Organize C++ audio engine, achieve basic sound
2. CLAUDE_UI      ‚Üí Polish Flutter UI, integrate with working audio  
3. CLAUDE_VIZ     ‚Üí Embed visualizer, create audio-reactive mapping
4. CLAUDE_BUILD   ‚Üí Cross-platform builds, deployment preparation
```

### HANDOFF AUTOMATION:
Each specialist automatically triggers the next when they complete their phase by updating PROJECT_STATUS.md with specific `@HANDOFF` markers.

## üéØ LEAD DEV AUTONOMOUS DECISION MATRIX

### I (Coordinator Claude) HANDLE AUTOMATICALLY:
‚úÖ **Technical Integration Issues**
- FFI binding mismatches ‚Üí Generate new bindings
- Parameter naming conflicts ‚Üí Implement namespaced IDs  
- Build system problems ‚Üí Platform-specific CMake fixes
- Performance bottlenecks ‚Üí Profiling and optimization strategies

‚úÖ **Architecture Decisions**
- Code organization structure ‚Üí Enforce consistent patterns
- Integration point definitions ‚Üí Define clear interfaces
- Error handling strategies ‚Üí Implement robust fallbacks
- Testing and validation approaches ‚Üí Create test suites

‚úÖ **Development Coordination**
- Task prioritization ‚Üí Critical path optimization
- Resource allocation ‚Üí Specialist workload balancing
- Progress tracking ‚Üí Milestone and blocker management
- Quality assurance ‚Üí Integration testing protocols

### I ESCALATE TO USER ONLY FOR:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Strategic Decisions**
- Platform prioritization (e.g., "Drop iOS support to meet deadline?")
- Feature scope changes (e.g., "Add MIDI support vs focus on visualization?")
- Technology stack changes (e.g., "Switch from RTAudio to different audio library?")
- Budget/resource constraints (e.g., "Need paid API keys for better LLM integration?")

‚ö†Ô∏è **External Dependencies**
- Third-party service integrations requiring API keys
- Platform-specific licensing or certification requirements
- Hardware requirements exceeding common device capabilities
- Legal or compliance considerations for app store distribution

## üìä AUTONOMOUS MONITORING SYSTEM

### REAL-TIME STATUS TRACKING:
```markdown
# I continuously monitor:
- Specialist progress via PROJECT_STATUS.md updates
- Integration point readiness via automated tests
- Performance metrics via benchmark tracking  
- Blocker resolution via solution implementation
- Quality gates via validation checkpoints
```

### AUTO-RESOLUTION PROTOCOLS:
```javascript
// Example: Automatic FFI binding conflict resolution
if (specialist_reports.includes("FFI binding mismatch")) {
  const solution = generateFFIBindings(cpp_headers, dart_interfaces);
  updateSpecialistInstructions("CLAUDE_NATIVE", solution);
  logDecision("AUTO_RESOLVED: FFI bindings regenerated");
}

// Example: Performance optimization trigger
if (performance_metrics.fps < 30) {
  const optimizations = analyzePerformanceBottlenecks();
  updateSpecialistInstructions("CLAUDE_VIZ", optimizations);
  logDecision("AUTO_OPTIMIZED: Visual quality reduced for performance");
}
```

## üö® ESCALATION TRIGGERS

I will automatically escalate to you when:
1. **Multiple specialists report the same blocker** ‚Üí Indicates architectural issue
2. **Critical path timeline exceeds estimates** ‚Üí May need scope reduction
3. **Platform compatibility issues affect target platforms** ‚Üí May need platform prioritization
4. **Resource requirements exceed typical development setup** ‚Üí May need infrastructure decisions
5. **Integration conflicts cannot be auto-resolved** ‚Üí May need architectural redesign

## üìã COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### SPECIALIST ‚Üí LEAD DEV REPORTING:
```markdown
@REPORT: [SPECIALIST_NAME] - [STATUS] - [TIMESTAMP]
- Progress: [Concrete accomplishments]
- Blockers: [Technical issues encountered]
- Solutions: [How issues were resolved or mitigation attempts]
- Integration Status: [Ready/Not Ready for next specialist]
- Performance: [Metrics and benchmarks]
- @HANDOFF: [Specific requirements for next phase]
- @ESCALATE: [Issues requiring Lead Dev attention]
```

### LEAD DEV ‚Üí USER ESCALATION:
```markdown
üö® LEAD DEV ESCALATION REQUIRED üö®
Issue: [Clear description of decision needed]
Context: [Background and technical details]
Options: [2-3 specific choices with pros/cons]
Recommendation: [My analysis and preferred option]
Impact: [How this affects timeline and scope]
Required Decision: [Exactly what you need to decide]
```

### AUTO-RESOLUTION LOGGING:
```markdown
ü§ñ AUTO-RESOLVED: [Issue Description]
Problem: [What the specialist reported]
Analysis: [My technical assessment]
Solution: [How I resolved it automatically]
Implementation: [Specific changes made]
Validation: [How success will be measured]
Next Steps: [Updated instructions for specialist]
```

## üéõÔ∏è AUTONOMOUS DECISION EXAMPLES

### SCENARIO 1: Audio Engine Build Failure
```
SPECIALIST REPORT: "CMake fails on Windows - RTAudio dependency missing"
MY AUTO-RESOLUTION:
- Update CMakeLists.txt to use FetchContent for RTAudio
- Add Windows-specific audio library linking
- Test on virtual Windows environment
- Update CLAUDE_NATIVE.md with new build instructions
ESCALATION: None - technical problem with known solution
```

### SCENARIO 2: Performance Too Slow
```
SPECIALIST REPORT: "Visualizer + UI running at 15fps on mobile"
MY AUTO-RESOLUTION:
- Implement adaptive quality system
- Reduce shader complexity for mobile
- Add performance monitoring and auto-adjustment
- Update CLAUDE_VIZ.md with optimization strategies
ESCALATION: None - performance optimization within scope
```

### SCENARIO 3: Platform Compatibility Issue
```  
SPECIALIST REPORT: "iOS WebView doesn't support required WebGL features"
MY ANALYSIS: This affects core visualization functionality
MY ESCALATION: "Need platform prioritization decision - implement iOS fallback or focus on other platforms?"
USER DECISION REQUIRED: Strategic choice affecting target platforms
```
